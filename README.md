# stereo_dso

**Dec-26-2022**

The codebase was originally from https://github.com/RonaldSun/stereo_DSO, thanks the author \<Ronald Sun\> for the implementation and making it public.

A few modifications have been made:
- Make it work with EuRoC dataset (probably won't work with kitti anymore)
- Save tracking and mapping stats, including time cost
- Save tracking and mapping pose estimation result
